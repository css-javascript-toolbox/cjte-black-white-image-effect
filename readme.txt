This CJT extension plugin can easily convert any coloured image into a greyscale image.

== Description ==
This [CJT Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/css-javascript-toolbox/) script extension transforms images into greyscale colours, and then changes them back to full colour on mouse-over. A setting can be changed to invert the effect so a colour image turns to greyscale on mouse-over. Includes a setting to tweak the transition effect speed. Uses the HTML5 canvas tag and a fallback for the older dinosaur browsers.

This extension is currently in BETA and the settings form is a little technical. In the next release, we will make this much simpler and user-friendly. More parameters will also be added later.

- Mouse-over (or hover) effect can be turned on or off
